Remember the [Yahoo! Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Directory)? It was this huge categorized listing of websites when the web was small enough to list out in HTML.

I love cycling. I love reading [The Radavist](http://theradavist.com/), but I also love the advertising. I've discovered countless indy clothing companies, neat accessories, and amazing custom bike builders along the way. I'm also forgetful. What was the name of that sock company that made the [PDX airport carpet socks?](http://www.theathleticcommunity.com/shop/pdx-airport-socks) or the [pizza top cap](http://shop.mashsf.com/collections/all/products/mash-pizza-top-cap)?

I thought it would be neat to create a directory of cycling stuff. All of it. Categorized. In one place. Want to add something to the site? [Let me know!](mailto:brian@emphaticsolutions.com)
